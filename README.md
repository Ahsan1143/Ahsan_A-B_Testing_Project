A/B Testing and Performance Analysis Report
Project Overview
This project evaluates the impact of a website redesign on user behavior through an A/B test. By analyzing key performance metrics such as conversion rate and session duration, the study determines whether the redesigned website outperforms the existing version.

Hypothesis
The redesigned website will lead to:
A higher conversion rate.
Longer average session durations.
Methodology
Experiment Setup:

Users were randomly assigned to two groups:
Control Group: Experienced the existing website design.
Test Group: Experienced the redesigned website.
Metrics Analyzed:

Conversion Rate: Percentage of users who completed the desired action (e.g., purchase).
Session Duration: Average time (in seconds) users spent on the website.
Statistical Tests:

Chi-Square Test: Assessed differences in conversion rates.
Proportions Z-Test: Verified differences in conversion rates.
Two-Sample T-Test: Analyzed differences in average session durations.
Results
Conversion Rates:

Control Group: 9.66%.
Test Group: 16.70%.
Statistical Significance:
Chi-Square Test:
Chi-Square Statistic: 10.2136
P-Value: 0.0014 (P < 0.05)
Proportions Z-Test:
Z-Statistic: -3.2893
P-Value: 0.0010 (P < 0.05)
Conclusion: The test group achieved a significantly higher conversion rate than the control group.
Session Durations:

Control Group: 301.22 seconds.
Test Group: 351.47 seconds.
Statistical Significance:
Two-Sample T-Test:
T-Statistic: -15.3971
P-Value: 0.0000 (P < 0.05)
Conclusion: Users in the test group spent significantly more time on the website.
Key Insights
Conversion Rate:

The redesigned website increased conversions by 72.97% compared to the existing version.
User Engagement:

The redesigned website extended average session durations by 16.66%, suggesting improved user engagement.
Recommendations
Adopt the Redesigned Website:

Deploy the new website design to all users to capitalize on improved conversion rates and engagement.
Explore Additional Enhancements:

Conduct follow-up tests to refine specific elements (e.g., layout, content, or personalization).
Monitor Performance Post-Launch:

Continue tracking metrics like conversion rate and session duration to validate sustained improvements.
Impact
The results demonstrate that the redesigned website has a statistically significant positive impact on key performance metrics. This validates the redesign and provides a framework for future data-driven improvements.
